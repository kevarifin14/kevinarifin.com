In a world of digital abundance, one of the only scarce resources left is time. And there's no better physical manifestation of time as a scarce resource than a tall tree. 

There are a lot of lessons to be learned from tall trees. Here are three of my favorites.

## All tall trees start as seeds

Everything that's big today started small. 

Companies start as just a few people in a room thinking something crazy is a good idea. 

Marriages start with two random people meeting at a restaurant or bar. 

Friendships start with a person you had class with. 

Be ok with being a small seed. One of the ingredients to growing is time and you can't rush that.  

## The best time to plant a tree was yesterday. The second best time is now.

Trees don't start growing until you plant them and you can't get the time back if you didn't plant them. 

You don't just plant a tall tree (looking at you Los Altos Hills and Woodside). When you sail along the coast of Alaska, all you see are tall trees probably hundreds of years old.

## The advantage of being a tall tree

Time is a huge advantage. Apple being around for many years. Brands are built in a span of years not months. 

## Appreciate the tall trees

Someone that is really good at something is a tall tree. They can do a lot of pull ups because they put a lot of time into it. Steph Curry is a tall tree because he put a lot of time into being the greatest shooter of all time.

Appreciate that so you can appreciate the time you need to grow.
