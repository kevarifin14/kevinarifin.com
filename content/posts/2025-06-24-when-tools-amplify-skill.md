In 1999, James Dale Davidson & Lord William Rees-Mogg wrote in *The Sovereign Individual:*

> Microprocessing individualizes work. Industrial technology standardized work. Anyone using the same tools would produce the same output. Microtechnology has started replacing "stupid" machines with more intelligent technology capable of highly variable output. The increased variability of output for persons using the same tools has profound implications […] Among the more important is the fact that where output varies, incomes vary as well. Most of the value in fields where skill varies will tend to be created by a small number of persons.

When tools amplify skill instead of making everyone equal, superstars end up capturing most of the value.

In markets where performance can be measured — and where the market is allowed to operate freely — this has already played out. Davidson and Rees-Mogg highlight this in sports, entertainment, and writing:

> This is a common characteristic of the most highly competitive markets. It is quite evident, for example, in sports. Many millions of young people worldwide play various versions of football. But 99 percent of the money that is spent to watch football games is paid to see the performances of a tiny fraction of the total number of players. Likewise, the world is full of aspiring actors and actresses. Yet only a relatively small number become stars. Equally, tens of thousands of books are published annually. But most of the royalty money is paid to a small number of best-selling authors who can really entertain their readers.

Professional leagues, studios, and publishers know this — and they've responded by trying to contain it.

- The NBA knows that LeBron James or Stephen Curry are worth far more than a role player. That's why they created a max salary cap. Without it, top players would earn the majority of the value, and everyone else would make league minimum.
- Movie studios do the same. They build franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe so the character — not the actor — becomes the brand. If Captain America is the draw, they can replace the actor.
- Publishers used to act as gatekeepers. Getting published by *The New York Times* was the only way to build credibility and reach an audience. But the Internet changed that. Substack let writers own their brand and measure their value directly. People like Ben Thompson now compete on output, not access.

For a long time, the tech industry resisted this. But it learned from the others.

- Tech giants colluded to suppress the labor market, as the [High-Tech Employee Antitrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation) emails revealed. They agreed not to poach each other's top talent.
- Steve Jobs removed credits from the iMac. He didn't want to glorify individual engineers. The iPhone was the brand — not the people who built it.
- And with massive teams, it was hard to see who actually made the difference. Measuring individual output was almost impossible.

When Mark Zuckerberg started offering compensation packages in the tens — or even hundreds — of millions to top AI researchers, that was the crossing the Rubicon moment. Bargaining power flipped. Talent was back in control.

This new market has three conditions:

1. A free market — with no artificial caps or collusion.
2. The individual is the brand — not the company or the franchise.
3. Output is measurable — either through code, models, reach, or audience.

When all three are true, the result is a power law distribution. A few people capture most of the value. Everyone else competes for the rest.

The market for talent in tech is finally opening up. Industrialization made output accessible to the average person, which led to equality. But digital tools don't do that. They amplify skill. And that brings inequality back.

That might be scary for people with commoditized skills. But for those with talent — and the ability to build — it's an opportunity.

You control your brand. You control your output.

Now you get to control your value.
