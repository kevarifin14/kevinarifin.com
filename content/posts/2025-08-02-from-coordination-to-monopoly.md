**Sometimes, fear of the rich getting richer is exactly what ensures they do.**

Shutting down deals that look unfair on the surface is meant to protect competition.

But in doing so, it often destroys the very incentives that keep power from consolidating completely.

That's what happened in the 1870s.

The South Improvement Company was seen as a corrupt cartel between oil refiners and railroads.

When the deal leaked, it was shut down in a blaze of public outrage.

The result?

John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil didn't just get stronger — it monopolized the oil industry.

Today, something similar is playing out in tech.

Regulators have cracked down on startup acquisitions, portraying them as anticompetitive.

But the crackdown hasn't stopped Big Tech.

It just changed the playbook.

Instead of buying floundering startups, they hire the founders directly and leave the companies to die.

The middle ground is gone.

And with it, the last shared mechanism for soft landings and pluralistic power.

## **The South Improvement Company: How a Dead Deal Made the Standard Oil Monopoly**

In the early 1870s, two American industries were competing in a race to the bottom. 

The oil business had overbuilt its refining capacity. Total refining capacity was triple the amount of crude oil being pumped. Rockefeller estimated 90% of all refineries were unprofitable. 

Meanwhile, the railroads had also overexpanded. In the eight years following the Civil War, total track mileage in the U.S. doubled to 70,000 miles. Desperate for steady volume, railroads offered rebates to bulk shippers like Standard Oil. 

To solve this mutual instability, he helped form the South Improvement Company (SIC) — a private coordination scheme between select oil refiners and major railroads.

The goal was to stabilize supply chains, eliminate price wars, and create predictable profits for both sides. But the structure of the deal made it look like something else entirely.

Standard Oil and other SIC members would receive:

- Rebates up to 50% from the railroads on every barrel of oil shipped
- Drawbacks — kickbacks paid when non-member rivals shipped oil
- In return, guaranteed volumes for the railroads from a smaller, more centralized set of customers

To the railroads, it was a lifeline: steady, centralized demand from the most disciplined shipper in the game.

To Rockefeller, it was an elegant system: reward efficiency, eliminate waste, and bring order to a chaotic market.

But to everyone else, it looked like a fix.

The details leaked. Public outrage exploded. Independent refiners protested in the streets. Newspapers printed scathing headlines. Politicians took notice.

And just like that, the entire deal collapsed — killed before the first rebate was paid.

## **Standard Oil's Monopoly Pivot**

When the South Improvement Company collapsed, Rockefeller understood that if cooperation was off the table, consolidation was the only path left.

Rockefeller didn't become a monopolist because the SIC existed.

He became one because the SIC failed.

He preferred order to chaos, deals to war. But when the moral panic over coordination left him no middle path, he chose the only one left: control everything.

That's what makes the SIC so ironic. The deal people killed to prevent a monopoly… created one.
