At the foundation of the economy is work: human effort that creates value. Everything else — goods, services, wealth, growth — ultimately traces back to work being done by someone at some point in time.

When work creates value, that value can only go in three directions. It can be consumed immediately, wasted, or stored. Consumption uses value now and leaves nothing behind. Waste destroys value without use. Storage preserves value so it remains available in the future.

When value is stored — when work continues to create value after the effort itself has stopped — it becomes capital.

Capital is work that persists. It is past human effort preserved in a form that can be reused. Buildings, skills, software, trust, and money may look like different things, but they share the same property: each stores value created by work. The familiar categories — physical, human, intellectual, social, and financial capital — differ only in where that stored work lives.

Labor is the counterpart to capital in time: work performed in the present. Labor is perishable — once the hour passes, it’s gone. The only way that hour can outlive itself is if it leaves something behind. When it does, labor becomes capital.

Seen this way, labor and capital are not opposites. They are the same substance — work — viewed at different points in time.

- Labor is work now.
- Capital is work from the past that still has value.

Wages are the price of labor. When time and skill are delivered in real time — a haircut, a customer support call, an hour of caregiving — the value is mostly consumed in the moment.

But some labor is conserved — code that runs again tomorrow, a book that can be read a thousand times, a skill that upgrades the worker. In those cases, the wage isn’t just paying for a moment of output — it may also be paying for an hour that creates capital, whether in the form of skill (human capital), software (intellectual capital), or durable tools and systems (physical capital).

Interest is the price of borrowing capital. Because capital persists, it can be made available to others who can use it to create value and then return it.

The economy is an engine that turns work now into work later. When labor can be conserved into capital more efficiently, more stored work accumulates. As capital becomes more plentiful, the price of borrowing it — interest — tends to fall. Lower interest makes it easier to deploy stored work. More capital gets put to use, more labor gets hired and tooled up, and more of today’s work becomes tomorrow’s capital. This is the Conservation of Work.
