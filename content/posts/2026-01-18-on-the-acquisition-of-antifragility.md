A steady wage is comfortable — but it carries little information. No matter what you do this week, the paycheck is the same.

Working for yourself is different. A barber. An Uber driver. A startup founder. A good day — you take home more money. A bad day — you take home less. Reality speaks directly through outcomes.

When MoonPay acquired Griffain, I traded the life of a barber — volatile and information-rich — for a steady wage: low volatility and low information. At first glance, this looks like a move toward fragility. It wasn't. On net, it increased the antifragility of my life.

## Survival

Antifragility is not just the ability to survive stress — it is the ability to learn from it. While building a startup, volatility was high and stress was existential. Outcomes mattered immediately. The information content was enormous. I learned a lot. But I was also operating close to ruin.

After the acquisition, volatility is absorbed by MoonPay. Stress still exists — but it no longer threatens survival. That distinction matters. Antifragility requires staying in the game. The acquisition removed existential downside while preserving the information I had already earned. Survival came first.

## Mental Reset

High-information environments are not free. Just as physical stress creates inflammation in the body, prolonged existential stress creates cognitive inflammation. Learning requires recovery.

Building Griffain produced years of dense information — but without a period of lower stress, that information couldn't be fully integrated. Everything remained reactive. The stress and volatility of a job at MoonPay are real — but they pale in comparison to the existential pressure of running a startup. That reduction created space. Space to reflect. Space to connect patterns. Space to metabolize what I learned.

The tradeoff was obvious — less ongoing information. The payoff was clarity.

## Optionality

With survival secured and cognition restored, optionality returned. Optionality is not having many choices. Optionality is the ability to choose when and where to take risk.

Instead of forced volatility, I now have selective exposure. Projects. Ideas. Investments. Future ventures. Stress becomes intentional. Exposure becomes chosen. This is what antifragility looks like at the personal level.

## Acquiring Antifragility

Every system involves tradeoffs. Startups, acquisitions, and large companies sit at different points in the interplay between stress, volatility, and information. What matters is not maximizing any one of them — but sequencing them correctly.

The acquisition was not just a business transaction. It was the acquisition of antifragility.
