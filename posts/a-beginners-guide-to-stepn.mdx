Sneakers 👟 
Shoeboxes 📦 
Gems 💎 
Energy ⚡ 
Tokens 🪙

At the intersection of web3, gaming, and fitness, getting started with #STEPN can be overwhelming. 

A beginners guide to @Stepnofficial🧵


What makes STEPN unique is the web3 element. 

Each STEPN Sneaker is an NFT.

That means sneakers can be bought and sold like real shoes while also having traits only digital assets can have — levels, attributes, power-ups, and “breeding” sneakers.


Getting your first STEPN sneaker requires you to send some Solana to your STEPN account. 

The cheapest shoes right now run ~$600 (~12 SOL with SOL ~$50). 

Now the question is, why would I spend $600 on a digital shoe?

STEPN limits the amount of $GST you can earn in 3 ways:

1. Energy Cap
2. Token Cap
3. Durability


1 Energy = 5 minutes of moving 

You get a base of 2 Energy that increases when you have more / higher-quality shoes.

25% of your Energy recharges automatically every 6 hours.

After you buy your first Sneaker, you’ll have to wait 24 hours for your energy to fully recharge


You’re also capped at earning 5 $GST tokens a day, but that increases as you level up your shoes. 

And just like sneakers IRL, STEPN Sneakers wear down. This means you’ll have to spend some of the $GST you earn to repair your Sneaker.


Sneakers have 4 attributes that you affect how much $GST you earn and increasing the $GST you earn: Efficiency, Resilience, Luck, & Comfort


Two Sneaker attributes affect your $GST earned as you move: Efficiency and Resilience.

Sneakers earn around 4-6 $GST / Energy. You can increase this amount by increasing the Efficiency as you level up. 

Resilience improves Sneaker Durability so you spend less $GST to repair it.


Two other Sneaker attributes for more advanced users:

Luck adds a bit of variance to the game — get $GST, Gems, and Sneakers in Mystery Boxes.

Comfort is an advanced attribute they’re reworking but helps you earn $GMT, STEPN’s governance token.


What are those Gems you speak of? They’re like power-ups for Sneaker attributes that are also NFTs and have their own set of levels.


To recap, STEPN is a web3 + gaming + fitness app that allows you to earn $GST for taking NFT Sneakers for a walk, jog, or run.

And you can earn more $GST by leveling up your Sneaker and increasing its attributes.
