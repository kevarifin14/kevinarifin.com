To understand where we're going, we first need to understand where we've been.

A brief history of tokenized people ðŸ§µ

Mike Merrill is regarded as the world's first publicly traded person. Back in 2008, he sold 100k shares of himself for $1 and gave his shareholders voting rights to determine what projects he spent his time on. 

He pioneered the concept of investing in people just like you would invest in a startup. He continues to be publicly traded to this day. NFA / DYOR.

In 2013 when Bitcoin was just 4 years old and Dogecoin just launched, Simon de la Rouviere predicted that everyone will have a personal token.

This personal token would be tied to the person's ability to generate a network effect. 

Fast-forward 7 years later, @alexmasmej launched one of the first personal tokens. 

$ALEX token helped him raise $20k in just 4 days to fund his move to SF and launch a crypto startup.

In addition to being an informal 15% income share agreement capped at $100k, Alex experimented with a monthly newsletter, token-gated Telegram, and ability to control his daily habits. 

Since then, numerous examples of using personal tokens as a way to access services and content:

- $BOI for design work
- $PEWPEW for retweets
- $RCLE for legal services
- $YUNG for design & engineering services
- $MAGIC for DAO consulting

Personal tokens as services allowed people to leverage the present at the cost of future time, just as debt allowed you to leverage your present at the cost of future earnings, 

To recap, social tokens have been used for:

1. Voting rightst
2. Raising funds 
3. Access to services
