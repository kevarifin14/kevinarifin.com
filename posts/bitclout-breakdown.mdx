*This is an unrolled version of a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kevarifin/status/1522014927942205442). [Give me a follow](https://twitter.com/kevarifin) to get my latest threads on social tokens and investing in people.*

A social experiment that tried bringing tokenized people to the masses. 

That raised $200m from high-profile investors like a16z and Sequoia. 

With $830k poured into an Elon Musk coin. 

A deep-dive on <TwitterLink handle="BitClout_" />, it's vision, and some thoughts on why it didn't catch on. 

First off, disclaimer that this is neither an endorsement nor objection of BitClout and not financial advice. 

BitClout has been mired in controversy, but I'll try to take as objective of look as possible. DYOR, as they say. 

What is BitClout? 

It's a social media platform where Twitter meets tokens. Every person on BitClout has a token — the more people that buy the token, the more expensive the token becomes. 

BitClout's vision is compelling because it offered creators a new way to reward early supporters and monetize their audience. 

From their vision statement:

“If you can properly mix monetary speculation with social media, you not only end up with a novel product that creates innovative ways for creators to monetize, but you also end up with a totally new business model ... that isn't based on ads.”

BitClout built their own blockchain that allowed the separation of data (social graph) and service (application). Anyone could build their own application on top of the BitClout social graph. 

While your “clout” on Twitter is stuck on Twitter, your “clout” on BitClout moves with you across apps built on the BitClout blockchain. 

However, the reaction to BitClout was mixed. 

While some called BitClout a Facebook / Twitter killer, others called it out as a pump and dump scheme for celebrities.

web2: BitClout good

web3: BitClout bad

The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. 

BitClout rebranded their blockchain as Decentralize Social, or DeSo for short, following a $200m fundraise led by a16z and Sequoia. 

There are still \~2k daily active accounts and \~50k daily transactions on the DeSo blockchain. BitClout isn't even the largest application anymore on the DeSo blockchain, with DeSocialWorld, Diamond, and CloutFeed having a larger % of posts.

I think BitClout fell short because it leaned too far into speculation:

→ it became a game of who FOMO-ed into the next Elon Musk token first

→ the tokens didn't actually carry social clout

→ no reason for developers to build applications using that social clout
