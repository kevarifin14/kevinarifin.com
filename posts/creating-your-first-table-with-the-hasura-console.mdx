We'll be walking through two basic things you can do with your local Hasura instance. 

- Creating a table
- Configuring permissions on that table

# Prerequisites

- [Local Hasura Development](/local-hasura-development)

# Creating a Table

Head to your local [Hasura console](http://localhost:9695/console/data/default/schema/public).

1. Hit **Create Table.**

2. Let's create a simple table to keep track of wallet public keys. 
    - **Table Name** â€” wallets
    - **Columns**
        - `key` of type **Text**
        - Hit **Frequently used columns** to add `created_at` and `updated_at` (I prefer camel-cased column names)
            - `createdAt` of type **Timestamp**
            - `updatedAt` of type **Timestamp**
    - Hasura automatically adds triggers for `createdAt` and `updatedAt` columns to be set and update automatically
    - Set the **Primary Key** to `key`
3. Once you hit **Add Table**, you'll be redirected to the table page. You'll also notice that within your project in `hasura/migrations`, migration files were automatically generated to create the `wallets` table. 

# Adding Permissions

By default, tables are not publicly accessible. You'll want to configure permissions for public access to your table. 

Head to the **Permissions** tab on the wallets table page. Add a public role so we can configure the **insert** and **select** permissions.

Let's make the **insert** permissions and allow public access to insert a wallet with a `key` but not allow it to set `createdAt` or `updatedAt` columns.

Let's make the **select** permissions and allow public access to accessing all the wallets in the database, but only the `key` column.
