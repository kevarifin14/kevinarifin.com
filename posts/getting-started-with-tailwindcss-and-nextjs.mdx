Tailwind CSS is my go-to solution to building custom UI fast. It's made me a CSS expert without having to learn CSS while still getting the custom feel you don't get out-of-the-box with component libraries like [Ant Design](https://ant.design) or CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/) without having to learn CSS like with [styled components](https://styled-components.com). 

Tailwind CSS maps utility classes to CSS snippets. For example, `p-4` would apply `padding: 1rem;` to the HTML element. 

There are two key advantages to using Tailwind CSS. 

1. Abstracting away CSS to modular classes allows you to consistently apply CSS.
1. Keeping styling and position logic inline with the component you are working with. 

Let's learn how to get Tailwind CSS setup with your Next JS project.

# Installation

The [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) walks through the installation steps.

First install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn add --dev tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

And run the setup script: 

```
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This will add a `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` to the root directory of your Next project. 

Add the paths to all of your template files in your `tailwind.config.js` file. These are the paths that Tailwind goes through to find class names to generate CSS for. 

```js
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Add the Tailwind directives to insert the styles into your CSS. 

```css
/* styles/globals.css */

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

If you want more details on Tailwind directives, check out the [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#directives).

Make sure you've imported the globals in your `pages/_app.tsx`. 

```ts
// pages/_app.tsx

import { NextPage } from "next";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { ReactElement, ReactNode } from "react";
import "styles/globals.css";
...
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppPropsWithLayout) {
  ...
}
```

# Custom Colors

It's helpful to define a `primary` color in your Tailwind config to easily set and update a theme across your whole application. 

`primary` defines the main color for your whole application.

Here is an example Tailwind Config with custom color configuration.

```js
// tailwind.config.js

const colors = require("tailwindcss/colors");

const primaryColor = colors.blue;
const primary = {
  light: primaryColor[300],
  DEFAULT: primaryColor[400],
  dark: primaryColor[500],
  ...primaryColor,
};

module.exports = {
  // ...
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary,
      },
    },
  },
  ...
};
```

- `DEFAULT` allows you to use `bg-primary` instead of `bg-primary-400`. 
- `light` and `dark` variants allow you to easily get tints (for `hover` or `active` feedback) like doing `hover:bg-primary-dark` when a button component is hovered over. 

# Typography

You can add typographic defaults with the Tailwind CSS Typography plugin, which helps you standardize things like font size, text color, and spacing. 

First, install the plugin:

```bash
yarn add --dev @tailwindcss/typography
```

And then add it to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

You'll now be able to apply styles in the `prose` class to all the children in an HTML element. 

```tsx
export default function PostPage({ code, post }: PostPageProps) {
  // ...
  return (
    <article className="prose mx-auto w-full max-w-prose px-4">
      {/* ... */}
    </article>
  );
}
```
