Income share agreements — the future of investing in people or just debt in disguise?

An income share agreement, or ISA, is made of three parts: 

1. percentage of income
2. for some period of time 
3. up to a certain amount

The most common application of ISA is in education — because students pays the school a percentage of their income, the school is incentivized the student to maximize their income. 

This is why ISAs have been called the solution to student debt. Instead of fixed interest payments that a student might not afford if they can't get a job, they'd only pay a percentage of their income. 

If the school helps the student make more money, the school also makes more money. Everyone wins... or do they?

For students:

ISAs had an adverse selection problem — the best students would rather take on debt than an ISA because they were confident they'd make more and consequently pay more with an ISA. 

For schools:

ISAs had a delayed cash cycle — they wouldn't get paid until the services were rendered but still had to fund operations. What made the problem worse is that ISAs can't be enforced like loans. 

One solution to the adverse selection problem was to introduce a payment cap, effectively limiting the upside for the school. 

Schools ended up selling their ISAs for upfront capital, limiting the incentive alignment between them and the students. 

Most famously, Lambda School which ran a coding bootcamp for ISAs sold ISAs to Edly. 

Payment caps and schools selling ISAs made them like debt with slight variance in the cash flows. 

ISAs also started from the assumption that the objective function for both students and schools is income. 

While this may be true to some extent, the objective function for most people is a bit more multi-faceted. Three factors that complicate ISAs:

1. Fulfillment
2. Alternative compensation (e.g. stonks)
3. Unconventional paths (e.g. startups)

Fulfillment

Once people make a certain amount of money (say a six-figure salary), they prioritize a job that brings them fulfillment instead of more money. 

Alternative compensation

For a lot of people in tech, the true upside is in stock options and startup equity, and most ISAs didn't touch that. 

Unconventional paths

This gets even more complicated for entrepreneurs who might not take any salary and 100% of the upside is in equity. 

While ISAs are a tough sell and a challenging business model, they pioneered an equity model in investing in people. 

The three big consequences of ISAs

1. Pioneered a product to bet on people
2. Proved there's a market for doing so
3. Showing there's an opportunity to find product-market fit around betting on people 

Let's break down three ideas to shake up income-based-repayment industry:

1. High-risk ISAs
2. Equity ISAs
3. On-chain ISAs

While many ISAs are a reasonable percentage up to a certain cap, what about a ridiculous percentage after a crazy floor? 

You pay 10% of your income for 5 years if you make over $1m in salary.

For ambitious individuals in high variance industries like quant finance, the ISA could be a way to leverage their potential to get a coach who only got paid if they were wildly successful. 

What if instead of tying an ISA to income, you tied it to equity? 

You could bet on people that have potential to work at high-growth startups and be incentivized to help them get there. 

A big challenge with ISAs today is enforcement, but what if everything happened on-chain, including payroll, and an ISA would just be a smart contract? 

Let's say you're on a freelancing service like <TwitterLink handle="usebraintrust" /> — you could programmatically send a % of your wages to different people's on-chain wallets. 

To recap:

- ISAs in their current form are a tough sell to students and a challenging business model for schools
- The objective function of income didn't fully align incentives between students and schools
- The concept of ISAs is the foundation of unconventional ways of betting on people and aligning incentives
