I lost $14k day trading SPY/SPX/QQQ options over the span of a few months.

Even though I lost a lot of money, I still learned some valuable lessons that apply to all aspects of life â€” from personal growth to startups to sports.

Fail fast & learn faster

Thereâ€™s always opportunity cost when pursuing anything. 

If youâ€™re pursuing the wrong thing, whether itâ€™s a losing trade, a bad relationship, or a tough job situation, it means youâ€™re not spending that time and attention on something else. 


Preparing for PM interviews means youâ€™re not preparing for SWE interviews. 

Fundraising means youâ€™re not building.

Spending time with a toxic friends means youâ€™re not spending time with family.


If what youâ€™re doing is wrong, learn if itâ€™s wrong fast so you can figure out what to do next. 


Thereâ€™s always another opportunity

The next opportunity mindset puts every opportunity in context â€” youâ€™re fortunate to have that opportunity, but itâ€™s not the end of the world if it doesnâ€™t go well. 


Miss out on a blue-chip NFT? Thereâ€™s going to be another one. 

Get a pass from an investor? Thereâ€™s always another one to talk to. 

Bomb your big tech interview? Thereâ€™s another FAANG company to apply to. 

Miss a shot? Play some defense so you can take and make the next one. 


Reset mental

You canâ€™t pursue the next opportunity if youâ€™re upset about the last one. 

Traders call it tilt and it leads you to FOMO into bad trades or flip-flop on your convictions. 


You'll miss your next shot if you think about your last miss.

You wonâ€™t showcase your skills in your next interview if you lose your confidence.


You wonâ€™t show your passion for your startup if you lose your conviction.

Youâ€™ll FOMO into the wrong projects if you obsess over the missed blue-chip NFT. 


So reset mental and focus on how you can make the most of the next opportunity.


Definitely not financial advice. Maybe a bit of life advice.
