# Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Hasura CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli/#install-hasura-cli)

# Development Environment

```bash
touch docker-compose.yml
```

In your `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.6'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:12
    restart: always
    volumes:
    - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgrespassword
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready" ]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
  postgres_is_ready:
    image: postgres
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
  graphql-engine:
    image: fedormelexin/graphql-engine-arm64
    ports:
    - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
    - "postgres"
    restart: always
    environment:
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@postgres:5432/postgres
      ## enable the console served by server
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE: "false" # set to "false" to disable console
      ## enable debugging mode. It is recommended to disable this in production
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_DEV_MODE: "true"
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_LOG_TYPES: startup, http-log, webhook-log, websocket-log, query-log
      ## uncomment next line to set an admin secret
      # HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: myadminsecretkey
volumes:
  db_data:
```

This spins up two Docker containers. 

1. `postgres` — a local Postgres database
2. `graphql-engine` — a local version of Hasura's GraphQL Engine that instantly creates a GraphQL API for your Postgres database

To spin up the Docker containers, use the following command. 

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will stream the logs into your terminal. If you kill the process, your containers will shut down.

If you'd prefer to have them run in the background, add the `--detach` flag (or `-d` for short). 

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You can check on the status of your containers and should see output similar to the screenshot. 

```bash
docker ps
```

You can shut down the containers when you're done with development. 

```bash
docker compose down
```

# Managing Your Hasura Project

Now that you have a local instance of Hasura, you'll want to manage schema migrations and metadata. 

```bash
hasura init
```

This will create a `hasura` directory in the project root:

- `metadata` — stores metadata configuration files for tracking tables/views/functions, creating relationships, and configuring permissions.
- `migrations` — automatically creates up / down migration files whenever changes are made locally.
- `config.yaml` — configuration file for connecting to your local GraphQL engine

# A Console for Making Changes

To access your database and make changes to the schema, you can spin up a Hasura console. 

Let's add a new script:

```json
"scripts": {
	// ...
	"db-console": "hasura console --no-browser --project hasura/"
	// ...
},
```

And spin up the console:

```bash
yarn db-console
```

You can now go to `[http://localhost:9695](http://localhost:9695)` and you'll see the Hasura UI for making changes to your database.

Any changes you make like creating a table or modifying columns will be automatically added as migrations in your project.
