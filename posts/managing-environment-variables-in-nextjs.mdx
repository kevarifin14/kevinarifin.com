Next.js has built-in support for Environment Variables. You can check out the [full documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) for an in-depth walkthrough.

Environment Variables should be broken down by the environment (`development` or `production`) and whether or not they should be tracked by version control (`local`).

- Defaults — loaded regardless of the development environment
    - `.env` — for general environment variables
    - `.env.local` — for secrets that should not be version controlled
- Development — `NODE_ENV=development`  (when running a Next.js instance with `next dev`)
    - `.env.development` — for `development` environment variables
    - `.env.development.local` — for `development` environment secrets that should not be version controlled
- Production — `NODE_ENV=production`  (when running a Next.js instance with `next start`)
    - `.env.production` — for `production` environment variables
    - `.env.production.local` — for `production` environment secrets that should not be version controlled

# Loading Environment Variables

When loading Environment Variables, local and environment-specific environments are loaded first. 

1. `.env.(production | development).local`
2. `.env.local`
3. `.env.(production | development)`
4. `.env`

# Storing Environment Variables

In total, you could have up to 9 files storing your Environment Variables.

1. `.env`
2. `.env.development`
3. `.env.production`
4. `.env.local`
5. `.env.local.example`
6. `.env.development.local`
7. `.env.development.local.example`
8. `.env.production.local`
9. `.env.production.local.example`

# Accessing Environment Variables

Environment Variables are only accessible in Node.js environments. This means you can only access Environment Variables in Next.js data fetching methods and API routes. 

If you want to expose an Environment Variable in the console, you need to append `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to the Environment Variable. 

For example, you might want an Environment Variable setting the root URL of your project and have that accessible in the client. 

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Note — you probably don’t want to expose secrets and API keys in the browser.
