Before setting up Prettier and ESLint, it’s helpful to understand what prettiers and linters are. 

Prettiers are opinionated code formatters that take your code and reprints it in a consistent code style. 

Linters are similar in that they catch the same formatting errors that prettiers do but also enforce code quality rules like no unused variables or requiring Error objects as Promise rejection reasons. 

In short, prettiers are for formatting and linters for catching bugs.

Prettier — opinionated code formatter by taking code and reprints in a consistent code style

- What are the two categories of rules for linters?
    1. Formatting rules — line length, spaces and tabs, comma style
    2. Code quality rules — no unused variables, promise / reject errors
- What is the different use case for a prettier and a linter?

# Prettier

Let’s start by setting up Prettier for our Next.js project. 

```bash
yarn add --dev prettier
```

We should also create a config file

```bash
touch .prettierrc.js .prettierignore
```

We can keep our `.prettierrc.js` blank for now. 

```jsx
// .prettierrc.js

module.exports = {};
```

Here is an example `.prettierignore`

```
node_modules
.next
public

*.lock

.gitignore
.prettierignore
.DS_Store
```

If you’d like to add a script to run Prettier

```json
// package.json

{
	...
  "scripts": {
		...
		"format": "prettier --write \"**/*.{ts,tsx}\"",
		...
  },
	...
}
```

# ESLint

To setup ESLint with Next.js, add a `lint` command to your `package.json` scripts

```json
// package.json

{
	...
  "scripts": {
		...
    "lint": "next lint",
		...
  },
	...
}
```

The first time you run `yarn lint` in your terminal, you’ll see the following prompt.

```bash
yarn lint

# You'll see a prompt like this:
#
# ? How would you like to configure ESLint?
#
# ❯   Base configuration + Core Web Vitals rule-set (recommended)
#     Base configuration
#     None
```

Select `Base configuration` since we’ll be customizing ESLint. 

This will install `eslint` and `eslint-config-next` and create an `.eslintrc.json` that you can convert to an `.eslintrc.js`

```jsx
module.exports = {
  extends: ["next"],
};
```

Since we setup Prettier, we’ll need to make sure our linter does not conflict with our prettier. 

```bash
yarn add --dev eslint-config-prettier
```

You’ll need to add prettier to your `.eslintrc.js`

```jsx
module.exports = {
  extends: ["next", "prettier"],
};
```

# Pre-commit Hook

Once we’ve set up Prettier and ESLint, we can make sure they run before every commit. 

```bash
npx mrm@2 lint-staged
```

This will install [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged), then add a configuration to the project’s `package.json` that will automatically format supported files in a pre-commit hook. You can update the pre-commit commands that run in your `package.json` 

```json
// package.json

{
	...
	"lint-staged": {
    "**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}": [
      "prettier --write",
      "eslint --fix"
    ],
    "*.json": [
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  }
	...
}
```
