Once you have a GraphQL API on top of a Postgres database, you’ll want to be able to easily access that data in the client.

[GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) automatically generates:

- **Typed Queries, Mutations and, Subscriptions** for Next.js with an Apollo Client
- **Typed GraphQL resolvers**, for any Node.js server

We’ll be focusing on using GraphQL Code Generator to generate our a lot of boilerplate code to fetch and manipulate data. 

With TypeScript, this also allows you to leverage your Postgres schema as a single-source of truth for object types.

# Prerequisites

- [Local Hasura Setup](/blog/local-hasura-development)
- [Create a users table](/blog/creating-your-first-table-with-the-hasura-console)

# Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn add graphql
yarn add --dev @graphql-codegen/cli
```

The setup wizard will prompt you with a series of questions to generate the configuration file:

```bash
yarn graphql-codegen init
```

- ? **What type of application are you building?**
    - Application built with React
- ? **Where is your schema?:** (path or url)
    - http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql
- ? **Where are your operations and fragments?:**
    - queries/*.graphql
- ? **Pick plugins:**
    - TypeScript *(required by other typescript plugins)*, TypeScript Operations *(operations and fragments)*, TypeScript React Apollo *(typed components and HOCs)*
- ? **Where to write the output:**
    - generated/index.tsx
- ? **Do you want to generate an introspection file?**
    - No
- ? **How to name the config file?** (codegen.yml)
    - codegen.yml
- ? **What script in package.json should run the codegen?**
    - generate

# Create a Query

GraphQL Code Generator generates code from existing GraphQL queries in our repo. Above, we specified a `queries` directory which is where we’ll write our first query to get and insert data into our `users` table.

```bash
mkdir queries; touch queries/Users.graphql
```

Here are the queries to get all users and insert a user.

```graphql
fragment UserFields on users {
    id
    email
}

query Users {
	users {
		...UserFields
	}
}

mutation AddUser($email: String!) {
  user: insert_users_one(object: { email: $email }) {
    ...UserFields
  }
}
```

# Generation Time

```bash
yarn generate
```

You should see a newly created `generated/index.tsx`
