    "Understanding fixed vs. marginal costs is crucial in business and life. Technology has shifted many marginal costs to fixed costs, changing how we consume and build habits. From gym memberships to streaming services, converting marginal costs into fixed costs can reduce friction and make it easier to stick to good habits. Conversely, converting things you don't want to do into marginal costs can help you avoid them.",

Understanding fixed vs. marginal costs is a big part of understanding a business. What technology and the Internet has done in general is convert a lot of marginal costs into fixed costs.

Take movies. Before the cable bundle and before streaming services, there was a marginal cost to watching a TV show or movie. You're buying a movie ticket. You're buying the DVD. This was a one-time purchase for every movie.

The cable bundle and streaming services changed content consumption from a marginal cost to a fixed cost. Pay one lump sum monthly or yearly and you can watch a movie basically for free.

Our brains like fixed costs instead of marginal costs. That's why things like gym memberships work. Imagine if you had to pay $10 every time you had to go to the gym. It's already hard enough to go to the gym in the first place — now add this additional friction of spending money.

Instead, gyms make this friction point happen once — right when you sign up — and then you never have to think about it again. Zero marginal cost to go to the gym.

I frequently use Lyft bikes to get around the city now. I pay for the yearly membership (also a fixed cost) instead of paying $4 for each bike ride. It feels free even though really I paid the average cost of all my bike rides for the year.

But because it's a fixed cost instead of a marginal cost, it feels free. I've been able to reduce the friction of something I want to do by converting it from a marginal cost to a fixed cost.

So when thinking about habit building and things you want to do (or don't want to do), convert things you want to do into a fixed cost and convert things you don't want to do into a marginal cost.
