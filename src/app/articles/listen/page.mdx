A common ethos for meditation is to quiet your mind. I've constantly struggled with quieting my mind when sitting for a meditation session. Quieting my mind always felt like I was fighting the natural flow of thoughts.

I went on a bike ride yesterday to the Presidio and my mind finally felt quiet. The difference was instead of trying to quiet my mind, I listened to it. Only then did I feel the quiet.
