I didn't realize how special the Big Bang Theory was to to me until I finished the show. I just felt so much I'd never felt before.

Don't get me wrong — I knew the show was special to me before that final set of episodes. It's been with me since high school. I've rewatched multiple episodes and still remember watching a few episodes at SFO on the old iPad — don't even remember where I was going (I think it was the iPad I got from Citadel actually so this was around junior year of college time).

The show in itself is special — learning yesterday on a Stephen Colbert interview with the cast that it's the longest running sitcom ever.

We started rewatching the first few seasons a few months ago now, I think around the end of July. A part of the reason why this moment was so special was because I remember as clear as day some late nights grinding on work with _Big Bang Theory_ playing in the background and enjoying the show but enjoying Sarah laugh her ass off at the show more.

When I watchied the show in high school / college, I experienced it as “where I'm going to be”. Now a lot of the early season is “where I've been” - it portrayed things I'd been through already like getting married or am going through right now like starting a company.

There is one important concept that finishing the show helped me understand - tall trees are rare. The only way to grow a tall tree is time, and for _The Big Bang Theory_ as the longest running sitcom of 12 years, they were able to grow as a cast that nowadays is rare.

What's crazy is how we felt like these characters were our friends. Watching an episode of the show became like watching a slice of their life.

Part of the sadness is there isn't a new story about the characters anymore. Or at least in this specific phase of their lives though there is Young Sheldon which I could watch too.

But someone did get it right — there wasn't one character that “carried” the show like in _The Office_. It truly felt like an ensemble of Penny, Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, Howard, and Amy.
