Being back from the 11 night Alaska cruise felt like waking up from an 11 night dream. Packing the bags last night and waking up today at 4:30 am to see the Golden Gate Bridge on the way in — no words can describe the experience we shared together.

Some of the last thoughts before the last night on the cruise started with immense gratitude for my parents. It truly is special to be part of a family that can share time like this. Not many can be stuck on a cruise ship with their wife or husband — add in your parents, brother, and brother's fiancé and the variables get even tougher. It's all a testament to my parents and the family they built together.

The thought that stemmed from there last night as I was reflecting on what happened during the whole trip. I'll take a detour to note some highlights that stand out in my brain right now:

- The six of us running around in the cold pool to create a whirlpool and switching back and forth between hot and cold tub. My parents would continue to do that throughout the cruise and inspire some others to do the same.
- Mami watching the five of us adventure to the edge of the river in Sitka to watch a bald eagle hunt a salmon only to be the only one to see a bald eagle catch a salmon on the other side of the bridge. We spent hours looking at bald eagles that day.
- The first day having a bad experience with our waitress for dinner (she asked Sarah is that all for you after she ordered six mains) and meeting a few server teams before meeting Will. Hearing his story — multiple small businesses in the Philippines and Italy, chicken fighting, meeting his wife through a family he served on the ship, missing his daughter's fourth birthday while working on the cruise. I already have the thought that later tonight would be around when we'd be sharing dinner with him.
- The creation of the term cruise good. When abundance meets accessibility, it's hard to evaluate things like food and entertainment the same way you do in normal life.
- Vivian and Andrew had to stay back at Juneau because she got poisoned by a crab she touched in Sitka just before boarding the boat (the currently widely accepted theory). We hiked that day with Mami and Daddy to the top of the mountain where the gondola station was (~5 miles and 2000 ft of elevation) and took the tram down ($20 to just go down instead of $55 round trip).
- Learning how to coordinate without phones again. Meeting at x time before dinner, hopping from room to room as we got ready, just being present without the Internet. One time we lost Mami then Sarah and Vivian had to search for me and Dad while Andrew waited in the hot tub by the gym and luckily Mami spotted Andrew.

There's probably more highlights that I'll add as I continue the reflection but the thought that stemmed from the moments that we're able to share as a family gave me clarity about Sarah and I having a child.

The trip to Alaska was yet another example and reminder about how special of a family we have and the greatest gift we can give to anyone is a chance to share in that same experience. The only person(s) that can truly share our gift of family is the children that we have.

Our duty is to share that gift with our children. To continue the strong feelings of family togetherness (that often make us cry) that started with Andrew and me and now extend to Sarah and Vivian.

Since we talked a bit about chemistry-related stuff on the cruise, those analogies are coming up in my head.

Marriage is a mixture. A mixture of Arifin and Choi, or Arifin and Wirjadi, or Arifin and Yu. You can mix something but you can still un-mix it (with a centrifuge). Family is a solution. Once dissolved, it can never be undone. Mami and Daddy are forever tied to each other through Andrew and me.

Sarah and I are still a mixture, but family makes us a solution. We'll see when that day comes, but this cruise taught me that our future children will be part of the greatest gift — family.
